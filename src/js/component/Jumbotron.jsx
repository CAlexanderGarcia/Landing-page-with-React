				Spacing utilities that apply to all breakpoints, from xs to xxl,
				have no breakpoint abbreviation in them. This is because those
				classes are applied from min-width: 0 and up, and thus are not
				bound by a media query. The remaining breakpoints, however, do
				include a breakpoint abbreviation. Bootstrap supports the
				latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms.
				Alternative browsers which use the latest version of WebKit,
				Blink, or Gecko, whether directly or via the platformâ€™s web view
				API, are not explicitly supported. However, Bootstrap should (in
				most cases) display and function correctly in these browsers as
				well. More specific support information is provided below. You
